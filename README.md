### What I learned

Today I learned a little bit more about working with images as backgrounds. I had the pleasure to play with positioning: absolute and pseudo classes in order to rotate and size up the background without modifing the card component.

This article helped me understand a bit more what I was working with : [How to Apply CSS3 Transforms to Background Images](https://www.sitepoint.com/css3-transform-background-image/)
